# Define While -
# Loops are function that use the while keyword
#  We need to give it instructions, like any other function
# keeps a program running so long as it is true.


#i=0
#while i < 100:
#    print('we are learning about loops')
#    break
    #i+=1
#print('our loop is done')

# break

# continue- skips the condition specified in your program.

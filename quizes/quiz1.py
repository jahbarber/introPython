# 2. Name three (3) operators we've learned about in class and describe

#Three operaters are arithmetic operators:when you need to perform common mathrmatical operators, Comparison operators:when you need to compare values, and Logical operators:when you need to compare true and false values.
# 3. Describe the difference between camal case and pascal case.
#Every word except the first word starts with a capital letter in camel case and in pascal case every word starts with a capital letter

# 5. You have been given a $100.00 dollar gift card from a family member. Another

# represents the total amount of money on your gift card. 
 
 
Amountofmoneyongiftcard = 185.50 


# 6. Create a variable that uses the input function and then print that variable. Your variable 
# should ask a user to enter their name.  


Name= input("What is your name?") 



# 7. You have been asked to create a program for a community center that wants to plan a cookout. 
# The community center wants you to build a form program and capture several key data points. 
# They want to know a visitor's full name, their age, if they have an allergy, and what their 
# favorite food is. You need to create the appropriate varialbes with the appropriate data type
# and use the input() function and print function to take in and print out the user's responses.

# If the user DOES have a glutten allergy, they need to eat a special type of bread, if the user DOES NOT
#  have an allergy they can eat the regular bread. What data type would best be used in this 
# scenario and how would you write a variable to represent this value?
#The boolean data type is the best to be used in this scenario. Glutenallergy=true or Glutenallergy=false

# 9. In your own words, describe what a program is?
#
#  A program is the way people make certain apps


# 10. Describe the difference between a float and an integer.
